This Contact Management System is a simple Java console-based application that allows users to manage their contacts effectively. The application uses HashMap to store and manage contacts, where each contact is identified by a unique name (key) and associated with a phone number (value). The system provides users with a menu-driven interface to perform various operations like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting contacts.
